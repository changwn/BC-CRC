# Bi-clustering based identification of colon cancer prognosis marker gene modules in complementary to CMS classification

Abstract
Transcriptomics data based Consensus Molecular Subtype (CMS) classification has been accepted as a standard rule for colorectal cancer (CRC) stratification. In this study, we developed a novel computational framework aiming to identify CMS stratification, prognosis, and drug resistance associated mechanisms, by conducting a bi-clustering based low rank gene expression modules in multiple large CRC transcriptomics data sets, and annotating the identified bi-clusters (BC) with their statistical associations to biological function, CMS classification and other clinicopathological information. Our analysis suggests that the bi-clustering based formulation cannot only identify alternative and disease subtype specific prognosis or drug resistance predictive markers but also generating new biological understanding to CRC stratification. Our key results include: (1) a comprehensive annotation of the BC landscape of CRC; (2) the BCs associated with CMS subclasses demonstrate the CMS IV is highly like a mixture of CMS I-III with high stromal infiltration while CMS I-III samples also contain certain cell populations show the characteristics of other classes; (3) BC based CMS dependent/independent prognosis markers suggests the disease progression free survival of CRC are largely determined by micro-environmental alterations while the overall survival is more associated with the level of stromal infiltration and CMS subtype markers; and (4) BC based predictive markers reveal alterative resistance mechanisms of Oxaliplatin, 5-Fluorouracil, and the FOLFOX therapy.
